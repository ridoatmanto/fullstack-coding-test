Given an array of N element [e1, e2, e3, e4, ... , eN], increment any duplicate elements until all elements are unique.
Please compute the minimum sum the resulting array elements.

Example 1:
input: [3,2,1,2,7]
output: 17

explanation:
the input has element '2' duplicates, so increment one of them to get [3,3,1,2,7]
the resulting array has element '3' duplicates, so increment one of them to get [4,3,1,2,7]
because there all elements are unique, compute the sum: 4 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 7 = 17
so we get the output 17.

Example 2:
input: [1,1,1,1,1]
output: 15

Example 3:
input: [1,2,2,2,2]
output: 15

Instruction:
you can write the solution by completing the source code in one of the directories corresponding to programming language of your choice.
